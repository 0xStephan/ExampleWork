Example of engineering application that was built

Python Controls:
Industrial IoT device that communicates between the controls systems and the user interface systems.
API takes API calls from front app (ie XamarinApp) and translates + communicates the requests via Modbus TCP to the controls network.

XamarinApp is a cross platform app which allows you to build and deploy for both iOS and Android.
XamarinApp connects to a private network and allows the user to interact with the engineering controls system.
