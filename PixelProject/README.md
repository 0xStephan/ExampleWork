# Pixel Project
This was an Australian project that wanted to create a unique NFT pass (ERC-1155).

They needed custom functionality for the NFT contract and also required certain requirements for a ReactApp.

One unique requirement was having a refund window for users to claim a refund from their mint if the project did not perform or if users were not satified with their purchase.


## How does it work?
ReactApp to allow users to mint a selective NFT pass.

This WebApp was developed using RainbowKit to ensure functionaltiy and compatability with a wide range of wallets.

RainbowKit at the time of development was very new so there was a mountain of issues that needed to be resolved.

Smart contract code is found in the following file: 
```
pixel.sol
```

ReactApp can be found in the folder labelled
```
ReactApp
```
