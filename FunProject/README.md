# Fun Project

Friend needed to quickly stealth launch and test an idea on the same day.

A quick front end of a basic gambling application with a smart contract was created.

How does it work?

There is a fee to join each round.

The winner of each round takes the entire prize pool.

This repeats as each round has more entries (thus the prize pool for each round increases).

Smart contract code is found in the following file: 
```
fundoge.sol
```

ReactApp can be found in the folder labelled
```
ReactApp
```
