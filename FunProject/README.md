# Fun Project

I was tasked to quickly develop this project for a stealth launch to test an idea on the same day.

A quick front end of a basic prize pool application with a smart contract was created.

## How does it work?

There is a fee to join each round.

The winner of each round takes the entire prize pool.

This repeats and each subsequent round has more entries (thus the prize pool for each round increases).

Smart contract code is found in the following file: 
```
fundoge.sol
```

ReactApp can be found in the folder labelled
```
ReactApp
```
